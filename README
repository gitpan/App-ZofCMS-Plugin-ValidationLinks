NAME
    App::ZofCMS::Plugin::ValidationLinks - plugin for people with bad memory
    to include Valid HTML/Valid CSS links pointing to validators

SYNOPSIS
    In your Main Config File or ZofCMS Template file:

        plugins => [ qw/ValidationLinks/ ]

    In your HTML::Template template:

        <tmpl_var name="val_link_html">
        <tmpl_var name="val_link_css">

    Produced HTML code:

        <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer" title="Validate HTML code on this page">Valid HTML 4.01 Strict</a>
        <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer" title="Validate CSS code on this page">Valid CSS</a>

DESCRIPTION
    The module is a plugin for App::ZofCMS. It's pretty useless unless you
    are like me: have a really bad memory on URIs and sick and tired of
    looking up all those links. The links are
    <http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer> for (X)HTML and
    <http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer> for CSS.

    This documentation assumes you've read App::ZofCMS, App::ZofCMS::Config
    and App::ZofCMS::Template

MAIN CONFIG FILE AND ZofCMS TEMPLATE FIRST-LEVEL KEYS
  "plug_val_links"
        plug_val_links => {
            html_text   => 'Valid HTML 4.01 Strict',
            css_text    => 'Valid CSS',
            xhtml       => 0,
        },

    Optional. The plugin takes its configuration via a hashref assigned to a
    "plug_val_links" first-level key in either Main Config File or ZofCMS
    Template. As opposed to many other plugins, this plugin will still
    execute even if the "plug_val_links" key is not present; as long as you
    include the plugin in the list of plugins to execute. Possible
    keys/values of "plug_val_links" hashref are as follows:

   "html_text"
        plug_val_links => {
            html_text   => 'Valid HTML 4.01 Strict',
        }

    Optional. Specifies the text for the "validate (X)HTML" link. Defaults
    to: "Valid HTML 4.01 Strict"

   "css_text"
        plug_val_links => {
            css_text    => 'Valid CSS',
        },

    Optional. Specifies the text for the "validate CSS" link. Defaults to:
    "Valid CSS"

   "xhtml"
        plug_val_links => {
            xhtml       => 0,
        },

    Optional. Pretty much the only purpose of this argument is for the
    "title=""" attribute of the "validate (X)HTML" link. Takes either true
    or false values. When set to a true value the link will have
    "title="Validate XHTML code on this page"", when set to a false value
    the link will have "title="Validate HTML code on this page"". Defaults
    to: 0 (false)

HTML::Template VARIABLES
        <tmpl_var name="val_link_html">
        <tmpl_var name="val_link_css">

    The plugin will set two keys in "{t}" special keys, thus you'll have two
    HTML::Template variables to use:

  "val_link_html"
        <tmpl_var name="val_link_html">

    Will contain the link to HTML validator to validate the current page.

  "val_link_css"
        <tmpl_var name="val_link_css">

    Will contain the link to CSS validator to validate the current page.

NOTES ON TESTING
    The W3C validator cannot validate pages that are not publicly
    accessible, i.e. (possibly) your development server; thus clicking the
    links from your local version of site will make the validator error out.
