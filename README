App-ZofCMS-Plugin-ValidationLinks

The module is a plugin for L<App::ZofCMS>. It's pretty useless unless
you are like me: have a really bad memory on URIs and sick and tired of
looking up all those links. The links are
L<http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer> for (X)HTML and
L<http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer> for CSS.
